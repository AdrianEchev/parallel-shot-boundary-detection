# parallel-shot-boundary-detection
This project uses OMP and MPI to cut a video into images, transform it into HSV format and apply the color histogram correlation technique to detect when there is a new possible new shot in the take.

In the same src directory, you must create an empty folder named "video_files_here" and add your video there. This is because GitHub hides empty folders in the repositories.
